# SyncFrame
SyncFrame provides a library for efficient message streaming across TCP/IP connections by combining multiple requests and responses into a single message frame.
It provides for a one way, unidirectional or bidirectional request-response semantics from client or server, and allows a configurable request intervals as well as message fragmentation.
