#### Return Value
Type: <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd321424" target="_blank">Task</a>(<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/269ew577" target="_blank">TimeSpan</a>)<br />A task which when completed results in a <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/269ew577" target="_blank">TimeSpan</a> that represents the difference between when the last sync frame completed and when the last delay completed.

## Remarks
The latency span is meant to be an instantaneous measure of what part of the delay in a sync interval isn't being used to transmit or receive data. Since several factors, including the quality of the connection itself, can wildly influence what this value will be, it's recommended that this value can be used as part of a gradual averaging strategy to tune the latency level of your application based on the quality of connection and volume of data over time. It's also recommended that you bound your latency under a maximum value representing the highest level of delay your application can tolerate.
